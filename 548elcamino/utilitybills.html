      <h2>Monthly utility bills</h2>
      <p>Below is a summary of the average monthly utility bills for the
        property at 548 El Camino Rd, Sedona AZ 86336, as of September 2024. 
        Not all bills are
        actually monthly; in these cases, the amounts are calculated by dividing
        the average yearly expenses (over several years) by 12. </p>

            <td> In October 2024, the two furnace/AC units were replaced by more efficient
                Lennox units. The Lennox furnaces are dual-fuel: electric heat pump, 
                with propane as a backup. It's anticipated that the new units will use less 
                electricity when the air-conditioning is on, but more when the 
                heat pumps are on. </td>

      <p>In the case of electricity bills, note that the property currently
        benefits from a program in which APS buys excess electricity generated
        by the solar panels. It's not clear whether new customers will get as generous
        a buy-back price as we do.
