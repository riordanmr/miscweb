    <h1>Shower at 548 El Camino</h1>
    <p>This page provides information relevant to fixing the downstairs shower
        at 548 El Camino, Sedona, AZ US.
    </p>
    <p>
        The problem with the shower (and tub) is that the temperature of the water
        cannot be changed.  A technician from Goettl's came out and said that the
        problem was that some parts are missing inside the Grohe shower control.

        I have made PDFs from the two Grohe manuals from when the new shower controls
        were installed on 16 September 2024.  The manuals are available here:
